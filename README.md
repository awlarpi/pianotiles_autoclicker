# pianotiles_autoclicker

pianotiles_autoclicker is a script that can play piano tiles 2. 

It takes a screenshot and scans for pixels on the screen corresponding to the colour of the tile. It then clicks below where the pixel was detected to account for the distance during the script's reaction time. The compensation distance scales with time as the game accelerates.

## Usage

I have not added autoamatic adaptibility for different positions of the game window, so users will have to set the target pixels for the clicker manually.

Additionally, each level will require different presets for initial speed and acceleration:

  beginner challlenge : speedgradient 0.037, initial 3.33
  single tile challenge : speedgradient 0.0875, intial 5

To use, simply complie and run the autoclicker.cpp file. Press s to start, and q to quit the program.
